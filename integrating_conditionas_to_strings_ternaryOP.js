const page = 'about';

//place conditions using a ternary operator to check if something is true perform it if not perform something else
//changing the class
//create/define a class if page is triple equal to about then print master layout if not secondary layout
//ternary operator made of 3 components- conditional if page is equal to home then question mark
//then what happens if conditional is true then a colon and then what if its not true

//you can perform on a single line

// instructions -in console log changing class
// start with backticks-define the class(normal string) $ then page is triple equals to home and render out the master layout
// if not render out the secondary layout
