//variable and then the name of the variable//multiple variables
var name, city, age;  // you have a name city and age variables
name = 'Kristine';    // name is set to kristine
city = 'Scottsdale';  // city is set to scottsdale
age = 12;             // age set to 12
//simply defining the variable above 
console.log(age);
console.log(name);
console.log(city);

//variables starts with var

// 2 basics was to declare variables
// var age = 12;          // var is something you can change
// let name = 'kristine';   // let you don't want to change/or can't change

// variables are tools to store data-like a bucket you can place items in it
// to get things to show up you must use console.log(what ever variable here)
// js alert    alert(name)
