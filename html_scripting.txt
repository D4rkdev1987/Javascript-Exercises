in the browser-to perform task content on the page
click on body in the elements and it shows what is in it
if you click on inspect and select something it will show you exactly what you select
console testing:
first say document;-gives an object of document-we are telling JS we want everything we see
next function document.getElementsByClassName('Class Name here');
if you open it it will show length for example-
if you click the arrows to drop down it will show you what you can call
find the innerHtml to select and change it---

document.getElementsByClassName('Class Name here')[0]; then use bracket notation
document.getElementsByClassName('Class Name here')[0].innerHTML = "Hi There";

(scenario if you need to change something on the fly)
