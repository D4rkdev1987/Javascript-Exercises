//data types are how javascript javascript categorize's all of our data points
// how javascript see's it

// Boolean- can have 2 values true and false-(is user a paid user or not example)
var truthy = true;
var notTruthy = false;

// Null-can only have one value which is null-the absense of any value-empty-is assigned(optional fields in example)
var nully = null;

// Undefined-allows you usually use when you are debugging-when it's simply just declared-no value set-not assisgned
var notDefined;

// Number-interpreter sees var and age and then checks the value 12
var age = 12;

// String-simply used for words and sentences
var name = "Kristine";
var nameTwo = 'Jordan';

// Symbol-similar to strings-cannot be changed and can only be one of them-immutable-works well with objects
var mySym = Symbol('foo');

console.log(mySym);
