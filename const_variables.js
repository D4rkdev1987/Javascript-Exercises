//var creates a global variable it might have conflicts with other variables BUGGY :) 
// let became the better way for a while and specific-not available other places

//const is the goto to decalaring variables
//in modern programs-always use const right away-unless it needs to be too specific then use let
//const gives you a tool-won't allow re decalaring/ re defining the value 
//we do not want to always want to redifine the variables
