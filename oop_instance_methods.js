  brayden.renderDetails(); //prints Brayden teacher
  //instance methods add behavior-you can add to classes-whatever you perform then object can have instance methods called on it

  //what we did above
  //we added instance--which are functions within a class-- ways to add behavior, and you can add them to your classes
  //in the constructor function we added a role with a default value as assistant--auto default
  //then we said this.role = role which sets the attributes up

  //now we are creating the instance method and not having any arguments in it
  //simply console log and use string interpolation with this.name and this.role --will print out the details for instructor MUST USE THIS
    //(when you instantiate a new instrcutor is goes from the call to the object constructor-then redirected to the values--why this is important)
  //now just say jon then renderDetails just like you are calling a function
